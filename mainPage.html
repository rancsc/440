              <p> Hi! My name is Rana Albassami. I am 23 years old and live in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. In fact, I spent my childhood in the UK but after my mother died, my father decided to return to Saudi Arabia. Six years ago, my family moved back to the UK again and my sister and I stayed in Riyadh to complete our university studies.
I love cars a lot, this passion is often unacceptable by our community. I did not care about this and started my passion with my father, who gave me the opportunity to know the parts of the cars and its kinds and how I could drive it. Also, I am interested in computer science. Computers first appeared in my life when I was seven. Then I had got my first computer. I remember myself thinking, that it was the best thing in the world.I could. Then I had got my first PC. At first, I was just playing computer games, but sometime later, I noticed that I could do a lot more things with the computer. Later I specialized in computer science and I studied many
